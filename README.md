### What is Composite Design Pattern?
The Composite Design Pattern composes the objects in the form of a tree structure to represent part as well as a whole hierarchy. Using this Design Pattern, we can access the operations of an individual object as well as we can access the same operations on a composite object in the same manner. That means the client can access the individual objects or the composition of objects in a uniform manner.
